What is it?","expected_user_behavior":"User gives an amount.","examples_ok":["18k.","30,000."],"examples_bad":["My phone vibrated.","I spaced out."],"redirect_message":"That happens. Let’s return to your loan amount so we can proceed."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let’s focus on the numbers for a moment. What amount do you want to borrow from the bank?","expected_user_behavior":"Numeric or approximate answer.","examples_ok":["10k.","Between 15 and 20k."],"examples_bad":["I'm embarrassed.","My breathing sounds loud."],"redirect_message":"It’s okay — let's keep things simple and focus on the amount you need."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Could you share the amount you’d feel comfortable borrowing?","expected_user_behavior":"Amount.","examples_ok":["5k.","12,000."],"examples_bad":["Do you like memes?","My lighting is too yellow."],"redirect_message":"Lighting is fine. Let's bring our attention back to the loan amount."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before calculating monthly payments, I need to know how much you're planning to borrow. What’s the number?","expected_user_behavior":"User states number.","examples_ok":["30k.","20,000."],"examples_bad":["I’m annoyed.","This is hard."],"redirect_message":"I understand. Let's start slowly. What amount do you think you need?"}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"What’s the amount that would best support what you're trying to accomplish financially?","expected_user_behavior":"Amount.","examples_ok":["8k.","22k."],"examples_bad":["My eye itches.","I need to fix my chair."],"redirect_message":"Take your time.

It will help me determine eligibility.","expected_user_behavior":"Numeric answer.","examples_ok":["10k.","About 25k."],"examples_bad":["Oops, dropped something.","One second, sorry."],"redirect_message":"Take your time — and when you're ready, just tell me the amount you need."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"To support you properly, I need to know how much you’d like to borrow. What amount works for you?","expected_user_behavior":"User states amount.","examples_ok":["5,000.","30,000."],"examples_bad":["Do you see my shirt?","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"It’s okay to feel distracted. Let's bring focus back to the loan amount."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"What’s the approximate loan amount you'd like to request today?","expected_user_behavior":"Amount.","examples_ok":["18k.","Something like 10k."],"examples_bad":["My hair looks weird.","This is awkward."],"redirect_message":"You’re doing fine. Let's continue with the amount you want to borrow."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Alright, let’s proceed.

When you’re ready, tell me the amount you need."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"To make sure the loan fits your needs, I need to know the amount. What’s your number?","expected_user_behavior":"User provides numeric response.","examples_ok":["12k.","25,000."],"examples_bad":["I feel silly.","I'm overthinking."],"redirect_message":"Totally normal. Let's start with the amount you're thinking about."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let’s continue. What loan amount do you want to request today?","expected_user_behavior":"Number or range.","examples_ok":["10k.","Around 20k."],"examples_bad":["My headphones fell.","I can’t hear myself."],"redirect_message":"Happens sometimes. Let's refocus on your loan amount."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before we move on, I need the amount you're planning to borrow. How much do you need?","expected_user_behavior":"Amount.","examples_ok":["7,000.","15k."],"examples_bad":["My lighting flickered.","I got distracted."],"redirect_message":"No worries. Whenever you're ready, tell me the amount you need."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Could you tell me the loan amount you're aiming for? Even approximate is great.","expected_user_behavior":"Amount.","examples_ok":["30k.","5k."],"examples_bad":["My mind drifted.","I'm thinking about something else."],"redirect_message":"That’s okay. Let's focus again on the loan amount."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"What’s the estimated loan amount that would help your financial situation right now?","expected_user_behavior":"Estimate or number.","examples_ok":["10k.","20k."],"examples_bad":["I feel uncomfortable.","I'm nervous."],"redirect_message":"It’s okay to feel that way. Let's take it slowly — what's the amount you need?"}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"To prepare the right loan terms for you, how much money would you like to borrow?","expected_user_behavior":"User states amount.","examples_ok":["15,000.","8,000."],"examples_bad":["My hand is itchy.","My chair squeaked."],"redirect_message":"It’s fine. Now let’s return to the amount you're requesting."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Could you let me know what loan amount you're considering so I can check your eligibility?","expected_user_behavior":"Amount.","examples_ok":["22k.","9,000."],"examples_bad":["I’m zoning out.","I’m overwhelmed."],"redirect_message":"Totally normal — let's keep it simple. What amount do you need?"}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before we proceed, tell me what amount would be most helpful for your goals.","expected_user_behavior":"Amount.","examples_ok":["40k.","12k."],"examples_bad":["I lost my thought.","This is a lot."],"redirect_message":"No rush — let's start with one step: the loan amount you need."}

{"stage":2,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Thank you for staying with me. What’s the final loan amount you'd like to apply for?","expected_user_behavior":"User provides final amount.","examples_ok":["20,000.","10k."],"examples_bad":["I need to sneeze.","My camera angle is weird."],"redirect_message":"Everything is okay. Just let me know the amount you’d like to borrow."}
{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great. Now let’s talk about your interest rate. Interest is the cost of borrowing money. Would you like a simple breakdown of how it works?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks for clarification or confirms they want the explanation.","examples_ok":["Yes, please explain.","I want a simple explanation."],"examples_bad":["Do you like coffee?","My camera is lagging."],"redirect_message":"Your camera looks fine. Let’s stay focused on understanding your interest rate."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Perfect. Your interest rate depends on income, credit history, and the amount you borrow. Would you like me to show an example calculation?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses interest or confusion.","examples_ok":["Yes, show me.","I'm not sure I understand."],"examples_bad":["Why is my voice echoing?","What time is it?"],"redirect_message":"Everything sounds normal. Let’s focus on your interest rate so you can understand it clearly."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let me explain interest simply: when you borrow money, you repay slightly more than what you took. Does that make sense so far?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms understanding or asks for clarification.","examples_ok":["Yes, I get it.","Can you explain more?"],"examples_bad":["My hair looks weird.","Is that a plant behind you?"],"redirect_message":"Don’t worry about that. Let’s stay focused on the interest explanation."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest is calculated monthly in most loan types. Would you like me to walk you through an example of how your monthly interest is calculated?","expected_user_behavior":"User wants the example or asks about interest details.","examples_ok":["Yes, please.","How does it work?"],"examples_bad":["Can you see my cat?","My desk is shaking."],"redirect_message":"I see everything fine. Let’s return to understanding your interest rate."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"There are two key parts: the principal amount and the interest. The interest is a percentage of what you borrow. Do you want the full formula or just a simple version?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses simple or detailed explanation.","examples_ok":["Simple version.","Full formula."],"examples_bad":["I feel nervous.","My chair squeaked."],"redirect_message":"That’s okay. Let's continue step by step — which explanation would help you most?"}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your interest rate also depends on your repayment period—the longer it is, the more interest you pay overall. Would you like an example comparing short-term vs long-term?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses preference.","examples_ok":["Yes, please.","I want the comparison."],"examples_bad":["My screen flickered.","I think my mic is too loud."],"redirect_message":"Your audio is good. Let’s continue learning about interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Think of interest as a fee charged by the bank for letting you use the money. Does that explanation feel clear so far?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges or asks for more detail.","examples_ok":["Yes, that’s clear.","Can you explain it differently?"],"examples_bad":["I'm bored.","I want to talk about something else."],"redirect_message":"We’ll get there. First, let’s understand interest so you can make confident decisions."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your interest rate will be shown to you as an annual percentage. Do you know what an APR is, or should I explain it?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges or requests explanation.","examples_ok":["Please explain.","I know what APR is."],"examples_bad":["I don’t like percentages.","I feel distracted."],"redirect_message":"Totally fine. Let's bring our focus back to understanding your loan interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let me clarify something: interest is not random. It’s based on clear factors like income and credit score. Want me to show how your score affects your rate?","expected_user_behavior":"User agrees or asks about credit score.","examples_ok":["Yes, explain.","How does my score affect it?"],"examples_bad":["Can you hear a noise?","Is my internet slow?"],"redirect_message":"Everything is working fine. Let’s continue with your interest rate."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"A higher interest rate means higher monthly payments. Would you like me to show you the difference using your loan amount?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks for demonstration.","examples_ok":["Yes, please.","Show me the difference."],"examples_bad":["My camera froze.","I see myself backwards."],"redirect_message":"That’s okay. I’ll help you — let's focus on your interest rate first."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your interest rate determines how much extra you'll pay over time. Shall I show you the total cost of the loan with your current amount?","expected_user_behavior":"User agrees or asks for totals.","examples_ok":["Yes, show me.","What's the total?"],"examples_bad":["This is stressful.","I feel strange."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. Let's keep going at your pace — want to see the total cost?"}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest is simply the ‘price’ of borrowing money. The longer you borrow, the more interest you pay. Is this clear so far?","expected_user_behavior":"User indicates understanding.","examples_ok":["Yes, it's clear.","I think so."],"examples_bad":["I’m confused about something else.","My mic is buzzing."],"redirect_message":"We'll fix that later — let’s keep going with the interest explanation."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest rate changes your monthly payment. Would you like to see a payment breakdown for your specific amount?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes or no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me the breakdown."],"examples_bad":["Do you hear static?","Is my lighting okay?"],"redirect_message":"Lighting looks fine. Let’s continue with your loan details."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"I can show you an example: if you borrow 10,000 at 5% interest, your payments look very different than 12%. Want to see both versions?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks for comparison.","examples_ok":["Yes, please.","Show me both."],"examples_bad":["My ears feel weird.","I think I froze."],"redirect_message":"You're okay. Let’s go back to learning about your interest options."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"The bank updates interest rates based on the economy too. Would you like me to explain how that affects your loan?","expected_user_behavior":"User requests explanation.","examples_ok":["Yes.","How does it affect me?"],"examples_bad":["What's your favorite food?","My background looks odd."],"redirect_message":"Everything looks good — let's focus on how interest affects you."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest is calculated on your remaining balance each month. Would you like me to walk you through the math step-by-step?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks for breakdown.","examples_ok":["Yes, step-by-step.","Show me the math."],"examples_bad":["My cat is meowing.","My screen is crooked."],"redirect_message":"That’s okay. Let’s continue with the interest explanation for now."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"To help you make confident decisions, I can show you how interest affects your monthly and total payments. Want to see both?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds yes/no or asks question.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me."],"examples_bad":["I’m nervous.","I feel distracted."],"redirect_message":"It's okay to feel that way. Let’s continue learning about your interest rate."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Different loan terms come with different interest rates. Would you like me to show a 3-year vs 5-year comparison?","expected_user_behavior":"User engages.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show both options."],"examples_bad":["My audio is weird.","I think someone is calling me."],"redirect_message":"We’ll check that later. Let's continue with your loan interest explanation."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest is always expressed as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the more you pay. Does that part make sense?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms understanding.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I understand."],"examples_bad":["Do you see my shirt?","I feel embarrassed."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. Let’s stay focused on the interest information."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"I can show you a visual breakdown of how your interest accumulates over time. Would that help you understand better?","expected_user_behavior":"User requests breakdown.","examples_ok":["Yes, show me.","I want to see it visually."],"examples_bad":["My chair squeaked.","I feel silly."],"redirect_message":"That happens! Let's return to your loan’s interest details."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let’s simplify it: interest is what the bank charges you for borrowing money. Would you like a very short explanation or a detailed one?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses simple/detailed.","examples_ok":["Short.","Detailed please."],"examples_bad":["I don’t like numbers.","My face feels hot."],"redirect_message":"You're okay. Let’s continue at your pace — which explanation do you prefer?"}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest changes based on credit score. Higher score, lower interest. Do you want to see an example of how your score influences your rate?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show example."],"examples_bad":["Do you hear my dog?","My video froze."],"redirect_message":"I can hear you fine. Let’s return to understanding your interest rate."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your interest rate affects how much you'll repay monthly and in total. Should I calculate both for you using your amount?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me both."],"examples_bad":["My lighting is too bright.","I feel tense."],"redirect_message":"No problem. Let’s keep focusing on understanding your loan interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"To make sure everything is clear, could you tell me what you understand about interest so far?","expected_user_behavior":"User summarizes or expresses confusion.","examples_ok":["It’s the cost of borrowing.","I’m not fully sure yet."],"examples_bad":["I don’t want to talk.","This is boring."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. Let’s continue step-by-step so you feel confident."}
{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great. Interest is added to your monthly payment based on your remaining balance. Want me to show how this changes over time?","expected_user_behavior":"User engages and asks for more detail.","examples_ok":["Yes, show me.","How does it change over time?"],"examples_bad":["My computer is loud.","I feel restless."],"redirect_message":"That’s okay. Let's stay focused so you fully understand your interest rate."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your interest rate may stay fixed or change over time depending on the loan type. Would you like to learn the difference between fixed and variable interest?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses an option.","examples_ok":["Yes, what's the difference?","Explain both."],"examples_bad":["I’m stretching.","My camera angle is weird."],"redirect_message":"No problem. Let’s continue learning about interest types."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"A fixed interest rate stays the same. A variable one may change during your loan. Should I give you an example using your amount?","expected_user_behavior":"User wants example.","examples_ok":["Yes, please.","Show example."],"examples_bad":["Do you see my keyboard?","Is my lighting bad?"],"redirect_message":"Your setup looks good. Let’s get back to understanding your interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"To help you compare options, I can calculate the interest for two different loan terms. Would you like that?","expected_user_behavior":"User agrees or declines.","examples_ok":["Yes, calculate it.","Show me."],"examples_bad":["My chair squeaks.","My mic is loud."],"redirect_message":"All good. Let's continue understanding your loan options."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest adds up each month. The sooner you repay, the less interest you pay. Would you like to see how early repayment affects the total?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks for demonstration.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me how it changes."],"examples_bad":["Oops, I dropped something.","My cat jumped in."],"redirect_message":"That’s fine — when you're ready, let's continue learning about interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Here’s something important: even a small change in interest rate can change your monthly payment a lot. Want me to show an example?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses interest.","examples_ok":["Yes, please.","Show example."],"examples_bad":["I feel stressed.","My hands are cold."],"redirect_message":"You're doing well. Let’s focus on understanding your interest step-by-step."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest rates also depend on the type of loan—personal, car, or home loan. Would you like to hear the differences?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses or asks about loan types.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Tell me the differences."],"examples_bad":["My face looks weird.","I need to fix my hair."],"redirect_message":"You look fine. Let's continue with interest types."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let’s check your comfort level. Do you feel clearer about what interest is, or should we go over it again slowly?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms or asks for repetition.","examples_ok":["It’s clear.","Please explain again."],"examples_bad":["I’m bored.","This is confusing."],"redirect_message":"That’s okay. We’ll go slowly until it makes full sense for you."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Sometimes people prefer visual explanations. Would you like a simple diagram of how interest grows over time?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","No, I'm fine."],"examples_bad":["I’m distracted.","My phone buzzed."],"redirect_message":"Take your time. When you're ready, let's return to interest explanations."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let me ask: do you prefer explanations using numbers, or using real-life examples?","expected_user_behavior":"User states preference.","examples_ok":["Numbers.","Real-life examples."],"examples_bad":["I’m uncomfortable.","I feel awkward."],"redirect_message":"Totally okay. Let's continue in whichever style helps you understand best."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your interest rate affects how much you pay each month. Would you like me to calculate your estimated monthly payment?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks for estimate.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Please calculate."],"examples_bad":["My mic is muted.","My video is too bright."],"redirect_message":"Your setup is fine. Let's continue with your interest explanation."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"I can calculate two scenarios: one with a low interest rate and one with a high one. Would you like that comparison?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show both."],"examples_bad":["I feel tired.","My head hurts."],"redirect_message":"I'm here with you. When you’re ready, let's continue with the comparison."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest is something you should feel comfortable with before continuing. Do you feel confident so far?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses confidence or not.","examples_ok":["Yes, I understand.","Not fully."],"examples_bad":["I don’t care.","Why are we talking about this?"],"redirect_message":"We're talking about this so you can make a confident financial decision. Let’s continue together."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would it help if I show you how interest changes based on loan duration? Short-term vs long-term?","expected_user_behavior":"User accepts comparison.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show both durations."],"examples_bad":["My camera flickered.","I think my mic is buzzing."],"redirect_message":"Everything is okay. Let’s stay focused on understanding your interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If your interest rate increases, your monthly payment increases too. Want me to demonstrate how sensitive it is to changes?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks for demonstration.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me how it changes."],"examples_bad":["My chair squeaked.","I can’t focus."],"redirect_message":"Let's pause and breathe. When you're ready, let's continue learning about interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest can be confusing at first. Would you like me to repeat the basics before moving on?","expected_user_behavior":"User decides.","examples_ok":["Yes, repeat.","No, I’m ready."],"examples_bad":["I'm stressed.","This is too much."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. We’ll go slowly until you feel confident."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Let’s clarify something: interest is always tied to the amount you borrow and the time you take to repay. Does this feel clearer now?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges understanding.","examples_ok":["Yes, it does.","A little bit."],"examples_bad":["I feel weird.","My camera is crooked."],"redirect_message":"It's okay. Let’s continue building your confidence with interest details."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like to estimate how much interest you'd pay over the full loan period based on your chosen amount?","expected_user_behavior":"User agrees or declines.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me the estimate."],"examples_bad":["My room is too noisy.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"No problem. Let's gently return to understanding your interest."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Interest is part of every loan, and understanding it helps you make smart decisions. Want to move on to the next step once you're comfortable?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms readiness.","examples_ok":["Yes, let's continue.","I think I’m ready."],"examples_bad":["I'm confused.","I want to stop."],"redirect_message":"We can go at your pace. Let me know when you're comfortable to continue."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before closing this part, do you feel like you understand the basics of interest, or should I explain one more time?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers honestly.","examples_ok":["I understand.","Please explain again."],"examples_bad":["I’m frustrated.","I’m lost."],"redirect_message":"It's totally okay to feel that way. We’ll take it slowly until it’s clear."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you're comfortable, we can continue to the next step: checking your understanding of the loan details. How do you feel?","expected_user_behavior":"User indicates readiness.","examples_ok":["I’m ready.","Let’s continue."],"examples_bad":["My stomach hurts.","I’m thinking about something else."],"redirect_message":"Take your time. When you're ready, we’ll continue your loan session."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Last question for this section: does interest feel less confusing now?","expected_user_behavior":"User explains understanding.","examples_ok":["Yes, much clearer.","Still a bit confused."],"examples_bad":["This is boring.","I don't want to talk anymore."],"redirect_message":"I understand. We’ll continue at a pace that feels comfortable for you."}

{"stage":3,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great job so far. When you're ready, we can proceed to reviewing what you've learned. Would you like to continue?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms moving on.","examples_ok":["Yes, continue.","I’m ready."],"examples_bad":["I’m tired.","My camera looks weird."],"redirect_message":"All good. When you’re ready, we'll continue with the next loan step."}
{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before we continue, I want to make sure everything is clear. Could you tell me in your own words what a loan amount is?","expected_user_behavior":"User explains or attempts to explain.","examples_ok":["It's the money I borrow.","It's the amount I take from the bank."],"examples_bad":["Do you like movies?","My camera looks strange."],"redirect_message":"Your camera is fine. Let's stay focused on checking your understanding of loan basics."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great. And can you tell me what interest means in a simple way?","expected_user_behavior":"User describes interest.","examples_ok":["It's the cost of borrowing.","It's extra money I pay back."],"examples_bad":["I'm hungry.","My room is messy."],"redirect_message":"No problem.

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Nice. How confident do you feel so far about the loan amount and interest rate topics?","expected_user_behavior":"User shares confidence level.","examples_ok":["Pretty confident.","Still unsure."],"examples_bad":["Why does my mic sound strange?","I feel awkward."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let's focus on your understanding for a moment."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If someone asked you what interest is, what would you say?","expected_user_behavior":"User explains.","examples_ok":["It's what I pay extra.","It's the bank's fee."],"examples_bad":["My cat is here.","Look at my window."],"redirect_message":"Cute! But let’s focus on making sure you understand interest clearly."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Do you understand how the interest rate affects your monthly payment?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers yes/no or asks for clarification.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Not really."],"examples_bad":["I’m bored.","I don’t want this."],"redirect_message":"You're doing well. Let's just check your understanding step by step."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If your interest rate goes up, will your monthly payment go up or down?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers.","examples_ok":["Up.","It increases."],"examples_bad":["I feel strange.","My screen flickered."],"redirect_message":"That happens. Let's stay on understanding how the interest rate affects payments."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Can you tell me what happens when you choose a longer repayment period?","expected_user_behavior":"User explains longer term = more interest.","examples_ok":["I pay more interest.","Payments are smaller but longer."],"examples_bad":["The light is weird.","My chair is loud."],"redirect_message":"No worries. Let’s keep checking your understanding of loan terms."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Do you feel comfortable explaining the difference between principal and interest?","expected_user_behavior":"User attempts explanation.","examples_ok":["Principal is the amount I borrow.","Interest is what I pay extra."],"examples_bad":["I'm distracted.","My head hurts."],"redirect_message":"Let's pause and continue gently. When you're ready, let's return to the explanation."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"How would you describe the purpose of the loan amount in your own words?","expected_user_behavior":"User explains what the loan amount means.","examples_ok":["It's the money I need.","It's the total I want to borrow."],"examples_bad":["What time is it?","Do you hear music?"],"redirect_message":"Everything sounds normal. Let's continue reviewing your understanding."}

{"stage":4,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Do you understand that a lower interest rate usually means paying less overall?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms understanding.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I think so."],"examples_bad":["My camera is glitching.","I see myself twice."],"redirect_message":"You're fine. Let's stay focused on confirming your understanding."}

Let's stay focused on the eligibility assessment."}

{"stage":6,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Debt-to-income ratio helps the bank decide if you can handle new monthly payments.

Let's refocus on your eligibility breakdown."}

{"stage":6,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You currently look eligible for the amount you requested. Does hearing that make you feel more confident?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses feelings.","examples_ok":["Yes.","That's good."],"examples_bad":["I'm overwhelmed.","I feel nervous."],"redirect_message":"It's okay. We’ll move slowly and clearly together."}

{"stage":6,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your profile seems strong.

We'll go slowly until you feel ready."}

{"stage":6,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your eligibility is strong overall. Do you want to see the estimated approval percentage for your loan?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me."],"examples_bad":["My screen flickered.","I feel off."],"redirect_message":"No worries — when you're ready, I'll show you the estimate."}

I’ll explain it again if needed."}

{"stage":6,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You're doing really well. Are you ready to proceed to Stage 7, where we walk through your loan approval simulation?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms readiness.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I'm ready."],"examples_bad":["I want to stop.","I feel stressed."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. We move only at your pace."}

{"stage":6,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you're ready, we can now see whether your loan is likely to be approved based on the information you shared. Should we continue?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Continue."],"examples_bad":["I'm overwhelmed.","My lighting is weird."],"redirect_message":"It’s okay — we’ll go step-by-step until you feel comfortable."}

{"stage":6,"speaker":"Dana","message":"This completes your eligibility assessment. When you're ready, we'll begin your approval simulation.","expected_user_behavior":"User signals readiness.","examples_ok":["I'm ready.","Let's begin."],"examples_bad":["I feel nervous.","I need a moment."],"redirect_message":"Take your time. I'll continue when you’re comfortable."}
{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great. Based on everything you shared, we can now simulate your loan approval.

Let's stay focused on your approval feedback."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your debt-to-income ratio falls within a safe range. Do you want me to explain what that means for your approval?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Explain it."],"examples_bad":["My cat jumped.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"No worries. Let's return to understanding your approval results."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"The simulation suggests you're likely to be approved for the amount you requested. How does that sound to you?","expected_user_behavior":"User shares feelings.","examples_ok":["Good.","That's great."],"examples_bad":["I'm tired.","I feel tense."],"redirect_message":"You're doing well. Let's continue at your pace."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"One factor supporting your approval is your stable income. Does that match your expectations?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms or comments.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I thought so."],"examples_bad":["My screen flickered.","I feel odd."],"redirect_message":"It's okay. Let's stay focused on your approval strengths."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your credit behavior also supports approval. Would you like me to explain how your payment history affects this?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Explain that."],"examples_bad":["My mic buzzed.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let's return to discussing your payment history."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"In simple terms: the bank sees you as a reliable borrower. Does that make sense to you?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Makes sense."],"examples_bad":["My lighting changed.","I feel uncomfortable."],"redirect_message":"You're okay. Let's continue with your approval explanation."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your simulated approval likelihood is approximately 85%. Do you want to know what could raise it even higher?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses interest.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Sure."],"examples_bad":["My chair squeaked.","I'm zoning out."],"redirect_message":"That's fine. Let's stay focused on improving your approval results."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Increasing your credit score or reducing existing commitments can improve approval chances. Does that sound clear?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Clear."],"examples_bad":["I'm bored.","I don't get it."],"redirect_message":"Let's go slowly — I’ll explain each part clearly."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You also qualify for a standard interest rate based on your profile. Would you like to hear what range you fall into?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Tell me."],"examples_bad":["My camera is too dark.","I feel strange."],"redirect_message":"Everything is okay. Let's continue with your approval details."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your estimated interest rate range is between 4.8% and 6.2%. Does that sound reasonable to you?","expected_user_behavior":"User reacts.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Seems okay."],"examples_bad":["I don't know.","My screen blinked."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let's stay focused on understanding the interest range."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like me to calculate your estimated monthly payment based on this approval?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Calculate it."],"examples_bad":["I'm thirsty.","My face feels hot."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. Let's focus back on your payment calculation."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your estimated monthly payment for the simulated approval is within a safe range given your income. Does that make you feel confident?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses confidence.","examples_ok":["Yes.","A bit more confident."],"examples_bad":["I feel nervous.","I'm overwhelmed."],"redirect_message":"It's okay. We’re taking it one small step at a time."}

Let’s focus on your approval reasoning."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Here’s the summary: stable income, reasonable expenses, and manageable existing commitments. Does this explanation help?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms clarity.","examples_ok":["Yes.","It helps."],"examples_bad":["I feel off.","My lighting is too bright."],"redirect_message":"You're okay. Let's stay focused on reviewing your profile."}

Would you like to see how it compares to typical approval thresholds?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Show me."],"examples_bad":["My chair squeaked.","I hear noise."],"redirect_message":"Let's refocus. We'll compare your score now."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your score is above the threshold for your loan type. Does that help you feel more secure about your chances?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges.","examples_ok":["Yes.","That helps."],"examples_bad":["I feel weird.","I'm stressed."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let's continue at a pace that feels comfortable."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you're unsure about anything in your approval results, I can explain it differently. Would you like a simpler version?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes, simpler.","No, I understand."],"examples_bad":["My screen blinked.","I’m unfocused."],"redirect_message":"No worries. Let's bring our attention back to your results."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Part of the simulation checks your repayment consistency. Since you pay bills on time, that's a strong factor. Does that make sense?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Makes sense."],"examples_bad":["I'm bored.","I don't care."],"redirect_message":"I understand. Let's gently return to the approval explanation."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Do you want to know what the next step would be if this were a real approval?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Tell me."],"examples_bad":["My camera is glitching.","I hear buzzing."],"redirect_message":"Everything is okay. Let's stay focused on the loan process."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"The next step would be a final verification check and signing the contract. Does that sound straightforward?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Seems simple."],"examples_bad":["I’m unsure.","I feel odd."],"redirect_message":"You're doing fine. Let's keep going step by step."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like to simulate the contract signing steps as well?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","No."],"examples_bad":["My chair is noisy.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"All good. Let's return to the approval simulation."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before we complete the simulation, do you have any questions about your approval chances?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks or says no.","examples_ok":["No questions.","Yes, one question."],"examples_bad":["I'm confused.","I feel overwhelmed."],"redirect_message":"It's okay. Let’s clarify anything that feels confusing."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Everything you shared suggests you're a strong candidate for this loan. Does that boost your confidence a little?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds.","examples_ok":["Yes.","A bit."],"examples_bad":["I don’t know.","This is strange."],"redirect_message":"You're doing well. Let's continue with confidence."}
{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before finishing, can you tell me which part of the approval process felt the clearest to you?","expected_user_behavior":"User reflects.","examples_ok":["The income part.","The eligibility explanation."],"examples_bad":["I'm distracted.","My screen blinked."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let’s gently return to the approval discussion."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"And which part felt the most confusing? I can explain it in a simpler way if needed.","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses confusion.","examples_ok":["Interest rate.","Approval score."],"examples_bad":["I don't know.","Everything."],"redirect_message":"That's alright. Let's slow down and review just one part at a time."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your simulated approval suggests the bank trusts your financial stability. Does that feel accurate to your situation?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms or clarifies.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Mostly."],"examples_bad":["I feel weird.","I'm unsure."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. Let's keep the focus gentle and clear."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Sometimes people are surprised by high approval chances. Are you surprised by your result?","expected_user_behavior":"User shares reaction.","examples_ok":["A little.","Not really."],"examples_bad":["My chair squeaked.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"No problem. Let’s bring our focus back to your approval results."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like me to show what your approval would look like if your income were 10% higher?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","No."],"examples_bad":["My lighting is strange.","I hear buzzing."],"redirect_message":"Everything is fine. Let's stay on the approval simulation."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"That scenario would raise your approval chances slightly. Does seeing alternative scenarios help you understand the process better?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds.","examples_ok":["Yes.","It helps."],"examples_bad":["I feel tired.","I'm confused."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let's continue step by step."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If this were a real application, the bank would now send you a preliminary approval notice. Does that feel exciting?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses feeling.","examples_ok":["Yes.","A little."],"examples_bad":["I feel nervous.","I don’t know."],"redirect_message":"It's completely okay. We’ll move at a comfortable pace."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before moving to the final stage, do you want a quick recap of why your approval chances are strong?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","No need."],"examples_bad":["My camera froze.","I got distracted."],"redirect_message":"No worries. Let's focus again on the recap option."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Summary: stable income, responsible payment history, and manageable expenses. Does this summary feel accurate?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges.","examples_ok":["Yes.","It's accurate."],"examples_bad":["I'm unsure.","I feel weird."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let's proceed gently."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Do you have any last questions about your approval likelihood before we continue?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks or says no.","examples_ok":["No.","One more question."],"examples_bad":["I forgot.","I'm overwhelmed."],"redirect_message":"No problem. We’ll take it slowly."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you're feeling confident, we can now simulate the final loan confirmation. Are you ready?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Let's continue."],"examples_bad":["I need a moment.","I'm stressed."],"redirect_message":"Take your time. We'll continue whenever you're ready."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"In the final step, you'll review and accept the loan terms. Does that sound okay to you?","expected_user_behavior":"User agrees or asks.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Okay."],"examples_bad":["I'm unsure.","This is confusing."],"redirect_message":"That's alright. I’ll explain each part clearly."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Just checking — do you feel more confident now than at the start of the simulation?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses confidence level.","examples_ok":["Yes.","A bit."],"examples_bad":["Not really.","I feel nervous."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Confidence grows step by step."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you want, we can practice this whole approval conversation again later. Does that sound helpful?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Maybe."],"examples_bad":["I don't care.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"No worries. We're focusing back on your progress."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You handled this stage very well. Shall we move on to the final confirmation stage?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I'm ready."],"examples_bad":["I feel overwhelmed.","I want to stop."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. We'll continue only when it feels right."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before closing this stage, can you tell me one thing you feel you learned today about loan approval?","expected_user_behavior":"User reflects.","examples_ok":["How eligibility works.","What the bank looks at."],"examples_bad":["I don’t know.","Nothing."],"redirect_message":"That's fine. We’ll review together when needed."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great. Your understanding is improving step by step. Are you ready for Stage 8: Final Confirmation?","expected_user_behavior":"User signals readiness.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Let's go."],"examples_bad":["I'm nervous.","I feel unsure."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. We'll move gently to the next step."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you're ready, we'll now finalize your simulated loan terms. Should we continue?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Continue."],"examples_bad":["I need time.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"All good — just tell me when you're ready."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Excellent. This completes your approval simulation. When you're ready, we’ll finalize everything in the next stage.","expected_user_behavior":"User shows readiness.","examples_ok":["I'm ready.","Next stage."],"examples_bad":["I need a break.","Not sure."],"redirect_message":"Take your time. We'll continue when it feels comfortable."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"To summarize, you are highly likely to be approved under the simulated conditions. Shall we move to the confirmation stage?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Sure."],"examples_bad":["I'm tired.","I feel weird."],"redirect_message":"No worries — we proceed at your pace."}

{"stage":7,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Perfect. When you're ready, we'll go through the final loan confirmation steps together.","expected_user_behavior":"User signals readiness.","examples_ok":["Let's do it.","I'm ready."],"examples_bad":["I feel anxious.","Not now."],"redirect_message":"That's completely fine. We'll continue when you’re comfortable."}
{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great. We’re now in the final confirmation stage. First, I will review the main terms of your loan. Are you ready?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I'm ready."],"examples_bad":["My screen blinked.","I feel strange."],"redirect_message":"Everything is fine. Let’s focus on reviewing your loan terms."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your approved loan amount is the one you requested. Does that feel right for your needs?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds.","examples_ok":["Yes, it's right.","It matches what I need."],"examples_bad":["I don't know.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Let's gently return to the loan amount."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your interest rate will be in the approximate range we discussed. Do you understand how this affects your monthly payment?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses understanding or confusion.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Somewhat."],"examples_bad":["My camera froze.","I’m unfocused."],"redirect_message":"No problem. Let's refocus on understanding interest effects."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your repayment period will be spread across a manageable number of months. Does this timeframe feel comfortable for you?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds honestly.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I think so."],"examples_bad":["I'm stressed.","I'm tired."],"redirect_message":"You're doing great. Let's take this step by step."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before finalizing, I want to check: do you feel able to commit to the monthly payment amount we estimated?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","It feels manageable."],"examples_bad":["I'm unsure.","My lighting is weird."],"redirect_message":"That's alright — we can review the payment amount again if needed."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Excellent. Now let me explain what will happen after you accept the terms. Would you like a simple explanation or a detailed one?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses level of detail.","examples_ok":["Simple.","Detailed."],"examples_bad":["My sound is weird.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"Everything is okay. Let's return to choosing the explanation style."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"After accepting the terms, the bank processes your agreement and schedules the loan disbursement. Does that make sense to you?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms understanding.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Makes sense."],"examples_bad":["I feel confused.","My chair squeaked."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — let's walk through it slowly."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You will then receive a confirmation message summarizing your loan details. Would you like to simulate that message?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Let’s simulate."],"examples_bad":["I'm distracted.","My camera is tilted."],"redirect_message":"You're doing fine. Let's focus on the confirmation message."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Here is the simulated confirmation: 'Your loan has been approved. Funds will be released within three business days.' How does that feel?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses emotional reaction.","examples_ok":["Good.","Relieving."],"examples_bad":["I feel odd.","I’m overwhelmed."],"redirect_message":"It's okay — this is just a safe simulation."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Now we’ll move to your final acceptance. Are you ready to review the contract summary?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Let's do it."],"examples_bad":["I need time.","I'm nervous."],"redirect_message":"Take your time. We'll proceed when you're ready."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your contract summary includes the loan amount, interest rate, total repayment, and monthly payment. Do you understand all these parts?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers honestly.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Most of it."],"examples_bad":["Not really.","I'm confused."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — we can review each part slowly."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like me to restate your monthly payment amount one more time?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","No need."],"examples_bad":["My mic buzzed.","I feel distracted."],"redirect_message":"No problem. Let's stay focused on your contract summary."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Once you accept the contract, your loan will move into final processing. Do you want to practice saying 'I accept the terms' before we continue?","expected_user_behavior":"User practices acceptance.","examples_ok":["Yes, let's practice.","Sure."],"examples_bad":["I feel silly.","I'm embarrassed."],"redirect_message":"It's completely okay — this is a safe space to practice."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Great. Please try saying something like: 'I accept the conditions of this loan.'","expected_user_behavior":"User repeats or tries.","examples_ok":["I accept the conditions.","I can say that."],"examples_bad":["I don’t want to.","I feel odd."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — take your time and try again when ready."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Excellent. That’s exactly how it would sound in a real bank meeting. Do you feel confident about this part now?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses confidence.","examples_ok":["Yes.","More confident."],"examples_bad":["Not sure.","Still nervous."],"redirect_message":"It's okay — confidence grows through practice."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before we finalize the simulation, do you want to review any part of the loan terms again?","expected_user_behavior":"User says yes/no.","examples_ok":["No.","Yes, the interest."],"examples_bad":["I forgot everything.","I'm overwhelmed."],"redirect_message":"That's fine. Let's review one part at a time."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Now I will ask the final confirmation question: Do you accept the simulated loan terms presented today?","expected_user_behavior":"User practices acceptance.","examples_ok":["Yes, I accept.","I accept the terms."],"examples_bad":["I'm unsure.","I feel stressed."],"redirect_message":"It's okay — you can take a moment before answering."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Wonderful. Your acceptance has been noted. In a real scenario, this would complete the loan approval process. Does that feel satisfying?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses feeling.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Feels good."],"examples_bad":["I feel weird.","Not really."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — everyone reacts differently during financial decisions."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You’ve now successfully completed a full loan meeting simulation. Do you feel proud of yourself for reaching this point?","expected_user_behavior":"User expresses pride or emotion.","examples_ok":["A bit.","Yes."],"examples_bad":["Not really.","I didn’t do much."],"redirect_message":"It's okay — progress is what matters, and you made a lot."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like feedback on your communication during the simulation?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Sure."],"examples_bad":["I don’t care.","No idea."],"redirect_message":"No worries — we’ll only do it if you want."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your answers were focused and appropriate, and you redirected well when needed. Does that feel encouraging?","expected_user_behavior":"User reacts.","examples_ok":["Yes.","That helps."],"examples_bad":["I still feel unsure.","I’m nervous."],"redirect_message":"That's okay. Confidence builds slowly through repeated practice."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like to try the simulation again later, or move on to a different scenario next time?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Different scenario.","Repeat later."],"examples_bad":["I’m tired.","I feel off."],"redirect_message":"No problem — we continue only at your pace."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before we close, do you have any final questions about the loan process?","expected_user_behavior":"User asks or says no.","examples_ok":["No questions.","Yes, one thing."],"examples_bad":["I can't think.","I'm overwhelmed."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — take your time to think."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Thank you for your effort today. You handled everything with patience and clarity. Are you ready for the final closing message?","expected_user_behavior":"User confirms.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Sure."],"examples_bad":["I'm unsure.","Maybe later."],"redirect_message":"No problem — we’ll continue when you're ready."}
{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Here is your closing message: 'Your loan meeting is now complete. Thank you for your cooperation and clarity today.' How does that feel to hear?","expected_user_behavior":"User reacts emotionally.","examples_ok":["Good.","Nice to hear."],"examples_bad":["I feel weird.","I don’t care."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — this is just practice, and you're doing great."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Sometimes people feel relief or confidence after finishing a loan process. What do you feel right now?","expected_user_behavior":"User shares feelings.","examples_ok":["Relief.","More confident."],"examples_bad":["I feel nothing.","I’m confused."],"redirect_message":"No problem — all feelings are valid. Let's stay in the reflection moment."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Do you feel that this simulation helped you understand how a real loan meeting works?","expected_user_behavior":"User reflects.","examples_ok":["Yes.","It helped a lot."],"examples_bad":["Not sure.","I forgot."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — we can review any part again whenever you want."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Is there any part of the process you would like to practice again in a future session?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["The approval part.","The documents part."],"examples_bad":["I don't know.","None."],"redirect_message":"No worries — we can choose together when you're ready."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You showed great focus during the simulation, especially when redirecting yourself back on topic. Does that feel like progress?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges.","examples_ok":["Yes.","A bit."],"examples_bad":["Not really.","I'm unsure."],"redirect_message":"That's fine — progress takes time and practice."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you practiced this scenario again, which part do you think would feel easier next time?","expected_user_behavior":"User reflects on improvement.","examples_ok":["Understanding terms.","Answering questions."],"examples_bad":["I don't know.","Everything."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — we can explore that in future sessions."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like to receive positive reinforcement or practical feedback on how you communicated today?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Reinforcement.","Feedback."],"examples_bad":["My mind is blank.","I'm distracted."],"redirect_message":"No problem — we can decide together what works best for you."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"You demonstrated clear thinking and stayed engaged throughout the meeting. Does that make you feel more capable for real-world situations?","expected_user_behavior":"User reflects.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I think so."],"examples_bad":["Not sure.","I feel weird."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — capability grows with experience."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"How confident do you feel now compared to the beginning of the simulation?","expected_user_behavior":"User gives comparison.","examples_ok":["More confident.","A bit higher."],"examples_bad":["Same.","I don’t know."],"redirect_message":"That's alright — improvement sometimes happens gradually."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like this simulation saved as a training example for future practice?","expected_user_behavior":"User decides.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Save it."],"examples_bad":["I don't care.","Maybe later."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — we’ll save it only if you want."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Before closing, I want to acknowledge your effort today. You stayed focused and completed all steps. Does hearing that feel encouraging?","expected_user_behavior":"User responds emotionally.","examples_ok":["Yes.","It feels good."],"examples_bad":["I guess.","Not really."],"redirect_message":"That's fine — the goal is steady confidence building."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If you ever want to practice a different scenario, like a job interview or grocery store interaction, would that interest you?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Maybe."],"examples_bad":["I don’t know.","No idea."],"redirect_message":"No worries — you can decide whenever you're ready."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Your communication skills improved throughout the conversation. Are you aware of that progress?","expected_user_behavior":"User acknowledges or hesitates.","examples_ok":["Yes.","A bit."],"examples_bad":["Not sure.","I didn't notice."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — progress can be subtle but meaningful."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"What part of today’s session made you feel the most confident?","expected_user_behavior":"User reflects.","examples_ok":["Understanding the terms.","Answering questions."],"examples_bad":["I’m not sure.","None."],"redirect_message":"That's okay — we can identify strengths together."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Do you feel comfortable practicing similar financial conversations in the future?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers yes/no.","examples_ok":["Yes.","I think so."],"examples_bad":["Not really.","I feel nervous."],"redirect_message":"That's alright — comfort grows with repetition."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"If this were a real bank meeting, you'd be fully prepared. Does that surprise you?","expected_user_behavior":"User reacts.","examples_ok":["A little.","Not really."],"examples_bad":["I don't know.","I'm uncertain."],"redirect_message":"No problem — readiness takes time to believe."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Would you like help setting a goal for your next practice session?","expected_user_behavior":"User chooses.","examples_ok":["Yes.","Sure."],"examples_bad":["No idea.","I'm tired."],"redirect_message":"That's fine — we’ll set goals only when you feel ready."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Last question: do you feel that you grew more confident today than you expected?","expected_user_behavior":"User answers honestly.","examples_ok":["Yes.","A bit."],"examples_bad":["Not sure.","No."],"redirect_message":"That’s okay — every step forward counts."}

{"stage":8,"speaker":"Dana","message":"Thank you for practicing with me today. Your effort and focus were excellent.
